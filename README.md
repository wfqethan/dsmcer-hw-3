## Homework 3 is due Wed Jan 18 at 8 am


### Description and purpose 

The purpose of HW3 is to give you practice with the statistical methods we have reviewed over the last 3 lectures:  calculating descriptive statistics, distributions, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.  

A secondary goal is to give you further practice with data visualization 

### Files contained in this skeleton HW repository 

* README.me: this file 
* HW3-SKEL.ipynb 
* energyuse.csv: student electricity use data, described below 
* GerberdingElectricityChilledWater.csv

### Instructions 

More details are in the Jupyter notebook for HW3. Follow through the notebook and complete all your work there. When you are done, check back in your work. I will check out your completed work and grade it and return to you via check-in when your grade is complete (at the bottom of this notebook).  

Note that I must be able to execute all cells in the notebook starting from top to bottom. I will not "clear all output" from your notebook and then execute it all in order to make sure the notebook works. 

#### Part 1: Descriptive Statistics 

* Calculation of descriptive stats and a box plot  

#### Part 2: Distributions 

* 

#### Part 3: Hypothesis Testing 

The file energyuse.csv contains energy usage data for 5 chemical engineering undergraduate students. The final line of the file contains the national average of the data.  There are three types of data given:  lighting, electricity and total (just the same).  

Instructions are given in the skeleton notebook. 

### Grading 

See cues in my skeleton notebook so you can get some information about what I am looking for on each section 

|  Part |  Earned | Possible | Notes  |  
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Statistics  | 30  |  30 |   |   |
| Distributions |  30 | 35  | outlier on BTU data (high values) makes x-axis too wide...  |   |
| Hypothesis testing |  35  | 35  |   | 
|  Other |   |   |   e.g., late penalty |
| Total grade |95 | | "e.g., good job" | 


### A note about comments

Like Dave explained - comments in python (using # in a code cell - or just adding a markdown cell) is critical so I can follow your work. You can't really over-comment things. 

### A Note about collaboration 

My expectation is that everything you type in a Python notebook is your own work.  Any instances of "copy-paste" from the web or another person's notebook should be clearly cited. Of course you may look at examples but it is my strong preference that you refrain from copy-paste and type everything in. There is a learning reason for this, which I am happy to discuss in office hours or on slack.

I will follow UW academic misconduct policy for any suspected instances of cheating on HW or projects. Any confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero on a HW assignment. Any 2nd confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero for the entire course grade.
